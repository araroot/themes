# Stage18 Critical Review (No Sacred Cows)

What changed:
- Re-audited categories inherited from original theme_park and replaced legacy labels with first-principles themes.
- Removed broad copied buckets (Auto Comp, New Gen, PSU Bank, Sin Stocks, FMCG, QSR, Oil/Gas, etc.).
- Added business-model driven assignments (coworking platforms, B2B distribution, digital marketplaces, fintech/insurtech, strategic defence manufacturing).
- Kept LO-* buckets only for genuinely low-confidence names; no Cross-Sector labels remain.
