# Stage10 Multi-pass Theme Build (All Tabs, Manual Truth Overrides)

Method updates:
1) Start from Stage9 full-universe assignment (818 symbols, strict 3-15 size).
2) Apply explicit fundamental truth overrides (STAR/AVL/TI/RADICO/ABDL/SENORES).
3) Recompute A/Core/B and outlier metrics from all dated PF_Ranks tabs.
4) Recompute theme summary and coverage diagnostics.
